# File Encryption Software

## Overview

This **File Encryption Software** uses cryptography to securely encrypt and decrypt files. By employing robust encryption algorithms, the software ensures the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information. The encrypted files can only be unlocked using a secure key, making it an ideal solution for protecting personal or business data.

## Features

- **File Encryption**: Converts files into an unreadable format using secure cryptographic algorithms.
- **File Decryption**: Restores encrypted files to their original state using the correct key.
- **Supports Multiple File Types**: Works with text, images, PDFs, and more.
- **Secure Key Management**: Ensures safe generation and handling of encryption keys.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive for both encryption and decryption processes.

## How It Works

1. **Select a file** to encrypt or decrypt.
2. **Generate or input a secure key** for the encryption or decryption process.
3. **Encrypt** the file to prevent unauthorized access.
4. **Decrypt** the file by entering the key to revert it back to its original form.

## Cryptographic Algorithm
This software uses [ ] to ensure data protection. This algorithm is known for its high security and reliability, making it a popular choice for encryption.
